Only 25.9%⁵ of the Malawi population have access to electricity with 11.3% connected through the national grid and 14.6% through off-grid solutions (solar lighting systems (7%), solar lanterns (3.7%) and solar home systems (1.5%), rechargeable batteries (2.1%) and generator set (0.02%)). Around 56.5% of urban households have electricity through the national grid, compared to 3.8% of rural households. In contrast, 15.9% of the rural households rely on off-grid solutions compared to 6.5% of the urban households. Gender gaps exist in access to electricity and modern energy cooking solutions. Based on the MTF survey in 2023, 31.2% of households in Malawi were female-headed with only 18% of these households having access to electricity. On the other hand, 68.8% are male-headed with 29.4% of them having access to electricity⁶. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.078,r=0.478,b=0.316), with ID d4e6a1e2-6d47-4a3e-b6c0-d696253a8cc2 -->

There is an increase in the use of SHS, Pico Solar Products (PSPs) and mini-grid systems. The Energy Policy 2018 adopted the Global Tracking Framework as a method for measuring electricity access which accounted for electricity provided by SHS, mini- and micro grid as energy access. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.327,r=0.476,b=0.411), with ID 72242010-1a53-40ec-bc31-44c018e5c9bd -->

3.2.1.  
Status of Regional Integration, Including Participation in Power Pool or Cross Border Power Trade

Construction of the 400kV Mozambique-Malawi Interconnector is underway and is expected to be completed by Q2 2025. Malawi has a bi-lateral agreement with Mozambique's national utility to import 50MW of firm power and will have the ability to export any excess power. At the distribution level, Malawi trades power with Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) in Mozambique and Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) in Zambia. However, considering the current electricity crisis in Zambia and the excess off-peak capacity in Malawi, there is an opportunity for Malawi to ramp up its energy exports to Zambia on the distribution network. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.063,t=0.211,r=0.478,b=0.489), with ID 5e9c7680-228f-418e-871a-c7299e3437ac -->

Achieving the objectives of Malawi’s Energy Compact requires seamless alignment across government sectors to ensure that energy acts as a catalyst for national development. Energy is not only a standalone priority but an enabler for transformative progress in key areas such as education, healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and tourism. Coordinated efforts among ministries, such as energy, finance, education, health, and trade, are essential to design and implement projects that leverage energy access for economic diversification, industrialisation, and improved livelihoods. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.608,r=0.477,b=0.779), with ID 67f56855-9e38-437d-924a-7ae9d0c2d3cb -->

Implementation of the Government’s strategic development agenda as encapsulated in Vision 2063 is anchored by the Agriculture, Tourism and Mining Plus Manufacturing (ATM + M) Strategy. The purpose of the ATM+M Strategy is to prioritise these four high-potential sectors to bring the Government back on track to fulfilling the first implementation plan of the Malawi 2063. The energy sector will play a critical role in powering agricultural mechanisation and commercialisation; tourism; and operationalisation of large-scale mining. The government has packaged some project proposals to develop transmission infrastructure such as the 132kV Eastern and the 400kV Western Backbone Overhead Line Projects. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.524,t=0.053,r=0.936,b=0.257), with ID 8b8a12cf-d803-41cd-bba5-a30496bc3abe -->

Malawi's mining sector is expected to experience a significant increase in energy demand to approximately 140MW over the next five years, driven by the development of major projects such as Kasiya, Malingunde, Songwe Hill, and Kayelekera. These projects, which focus on high-value commodities like graphite, rare earth elements, and uranium, have projected energy needs ranging from 10 MW for smaller-scale operations to over 60 MW for larger, multi-phase developments. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.525,t=0.270,r=0.935,b=0.411), with ID 0b40095f-4d55-4010-af3d-109d8d444788 -->

There are 1,050 health facilities in Malawi with fixed infrastructure and permanent staff. 83% of these facilities are connected to the national grid but experience power interruptions due to load shedding and inability to pay. Furthermore, 50% of the facilities have either standalone solar PV or a hybrid system with the grid. Most solar PV systems only provide electricity to a limited number of appliances and are also associated with concerns over their long-term maintenance. Over 900 rural health posts are expected to be constructed by 2030¹⁴. This highlights the Government’s commitment to ensuring equitable access to electricity among both urban and rural populations. About 177 health facilities will be electrified through stand-alone Solar PV as in Table 8 below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.525,t=0.424,r=0.935,b=0.643), with ID ffbd9df0-72b5-43c4-a987-4ffa2fa1f757 -->

Similarly, there are 8,728 schools in Malawi with only 33% connected to the national grid. There is precedent for solar PV electrification in schools with mixed results. A significant number of new schools are planned for construction without concrete plans for energy supply. According to the Integrated Energy Plan (2022), standalone solar PV could be the primary source of power for approximately 3,300 schools in Table 8 below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.525,t=0.657,r=0.935,b=0.783), with ID 30c6f00a-ab8c-46aa-9fe6-7638b4d7b706 -->

3.3.4.  
Status of Cleaner Cooking Sector

Over 98% of all domestic energy comes from biomass and supports cooking needs. Much of this biomass is unsustainably sourced. By 2021, forest cover had decreased by 37% relative to its level in 1990. If this trend continues, Malawi could lose its entire forest cover within the next 50 years. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.063,t=0.370,r=0.475,b=0.518), with ID 030d61d9-7510-4391-89c4-801e944098b8 -->

This reliance on unsustainable biomass contributes to the negative global impacts of climate change, which are increasing the severity and frequency of extreme weather events, as well as negative local impacts of such weather (particularly droughts, flooding and landslides), causing humanitarian crises in the country yearly and disrupting the national grid’s large share of hydroelectric generation. A transition to cleaner cooking solutions is vital to the environmental, economic and social stability of the country. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.531,r=0.475,b=0.688), with ID 495ee467-ed7a-495b-a4b9-573b44b3c371 -->

The vast majority of the nation’s households fit into two broad categories: those who gather biomass (mainly firewood) for free from their local environment - 66.9% of all households are largely located in rural areas; and those who purchase unsustainably harvested biomass (mainly charcoal) - 26.5% of all households which are largely concentrated in urban areas. These two segments of the population require different strategies to realise a transition to cleaner cooking solutions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.065,t=0.700,r=0.476,b=0.843), with ID 0900b34b-58c0-47eb-bf29-2414f7f6c5b1 -->

In rural Malawi, 99% of the households use biomass for cooking and 80% gather their biomass for free (72.8% firewood and 6.8% crop residue) meaning that willingness to pay for cleaner cooking solutions is low and <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.066,t=0.856,r=0.475,b=0.922), with ID 2eb25e75-e95e-4627-8ed5-f2d765d8f2ba -->

demonstrated by the adoption of improved or clean stoves being just 24.5%; many of which are likely to have been distributed for free or at heavily discounted prices by development projects. The majority of the rural population, which relies almost entirely on subsistence farming for income, has an exceptionally low ability and willingness to pay for cooking energy, and will therefore rely on freely collected biomass as its primary cooking fuel for at least the next 10-20 years. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.526,t=0.244,r=0.935,b=0.382), with ID 27d4ebbc-08b6-487e-ac92-160956af3426 -->

Urban households rely heavily on illegal, unsustainably sourced charcoal (58% - 82%) – a trend which has been increasing over the last 10 years. The census data from 2010 – 2019 shows that the share of urban households primarily using charcoal for cooking increased from 46% to 78%, with detrimental effects on forest degradation. However, more recent urban studies have shown that between 2020 and 2022 the percentage of urban households using charcoal as their primary source of cooking energy reduced from 86% to 82% thanks to targeted efforts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.526,t=0.384,r=0.934,b=0.553), with ID 16a14e06-91cd-4324-9171-27682963207c -->

The increase in charcoal consumption has largely been driven by urban households, who previously primarily used purchased firewood or electricity for cooking switching to charcoal. This is despite increases in the cost of charcoal which is accelerating - more than doubling between 2020 and 2022 and showing no signs of slowing. In fact, today cooking with clean solutions may cost as little as a quarter of cooking with charcoal. Reasons for not switching to more sustainable alternatives include their perceived higher cost both upfront (to purchase the cooking device) and in the long term (the ongoing cost of the energy source), a lack of awareness and availability of alternatives and cultural barriers to behaviour change. Reduced (even if still harmful) exposure to air pollution from charcoal compared to wood (and reduced health impacts) could also be a factor in the growth of charcoal demand relative to wood. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.526,t=0.569,r=0.934,b=0.816), with ID afa3381a-f841-4368-8650-1a286501d53b -->

To achieve 75% access to clean cooking by 2030, the country aspires to provide cleaner cooking solutions to 100,000 households in urban areas and 490,000 households in rural areas annually. This will move 38% of the households from Tier 0 of the MTF from the current 10%.

  Status of Policy and Regulatory Frameworks

Malawi adopted the MTF^15 for measuring energy access for both electricity and modern cooking energy in the 2018 National Energy Policy. In order to accelerate electrification and transition to clean cooking, the country developed the following instruments: National Electrification Strategy (NES); Malawi Renewable Energy Strategy; Malawi Rural Electrification Masterplan; Mini-Grid Regulatory Framework; Integrated Resource Plan; E-cooking Roadmap; Malawi Clean Cooking Compact-UN of 2021; and IPP Framework. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.280,r=0.478,b=0.507), with ID 81102a47-14dd-4724-ac3d-b4b14625afde -->

The country is also subscribed to the Sustainable Energy for All (SEforAll) Initiative whose overall goal is to achieve universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, efficient, and modern energy services. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.063,t=0.518,r=0.477,b=0.586), with ID e827c16b-9ac2-4546-a3f8-1bcaece41d62 -->

3.3.6.  
Affordability Levels and Steps Taken to Increase Affordability

Affordability to electrification remains a critical barrier, especially for low-income households. To address these affordability issues, the Malawi Government is implementing various strategies which include free and subsidised connections; grid densification through the Ndawala Initiative, provision of ready boards, and on-bill financing initiatives; improving the efficiency of ESCOM and service delivery, through implementation of advanced metering technologies; rural electrification efforts to both households and public institutions; tariff reforms; and public-private partnerships. It has been estimated that 2,100 sites will be electrified under MAREP by 2030. This will cost about USD 126 million. Similarly, 3 Mini-grids will be <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.611,r=0.477,b=0.887), with ID 08952a17-3858-4587-9a04-a0d599c25aee -->

developed by 2030 costing about USD 3 million and 57,000 will be supported with house wiring under Ndawala at a cost of USD 13.6 million. Therefore, a total of USD 142.3 million is expected to be contributed by Government mainly through the Rural Electrification Levy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.524,t=0.051,r=0.937,b=0.134), with ID 87d0873c-2474-412e-8a56-e75c6105dc0a -->

Several development agencies have initiatives relating to the electrification of health facilities while being active in the construction of schools but not in their energy supply. The private sector has also been typically involved in Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) and operation and maintenance (O&M) contracts. Others are also proactively developing business models for Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) for public facilities, communities and businesses. Furthermore, the Government has developed a least-cost masterplan to ensure increased affordability for grid connections. Under this compact, the design of the MV and LV networks is also grounded in IEP Geospatial planning, which promotes cost-effective solutions, particularly in rural areas. For instance, the use of smaller conductor sizes. On the other hand, the Government plans to increase the affordability of off-grid access through the implementation of Solar Home Systems. The government is expected to contribute about USD 1.5 million towards the provision of SHS to 10,000 less privileged households. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.524,t=0.145,r=0.937,b=0.444), with ID da5ada20-a6ca-4aab-80bc-6da7068c2ec8 -->

The following are additional strategies aimed at increasing service reliability for on-grid access by ESCOM Limited: implementation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), mechanization, and zoning; implementation of reforms on financial and risk management; implementation of resilience framework; and rehabilitation and modernisation of aged infrastructure. To increase reliability for off-grid access, the Government will scale up capacity-building initiatives through TEVET artisan programs such as installations, wiring and maintenance of off-grid systems. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.525,t=0.455,r=0.936,b=0.613), with ID 0e8d4b95-f01b-47e1-9341-7ecfd27094b4 -->

Similarly, the affordability of clean cooking technologies in Malawi remains a significant challenge due to the high upfront costs of clean cookstoves and sustainable fuels, and limited access to financing. To address these issues, the Government intends to establish a Malawi Clean Cooking Fund and provide alternative financing options for clean cooking. The Clean Cooking Fund will be established and capitalised in collaboration with a variety of development partners. The Government of Malawi (GOM) will establish a task force with representatives from the Ministries of Natural Resources, Climate Change, and Energy to enhance oversight and coordination in the <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.525,t=0.626,r=0.935,b=0.813), with ID 3c192bb8-d8cc-441a-8460-f91029b59baf -->

The existing policy and regulatory frameworks provide for private sector participation in on-grid power generation and transmission except for distribution and access. Currently, the private sector is only participating in power generation and off-grid electrification. Out of the total installed generation capacity of 550MW, the private sector contributes 112MW comprising 101MW from solar and 11MW from hydro. The policy and regulatory frameworks intend to further facilitate the private sector participation in DRE, especially by providing off-grid solutions through SHS. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.065,t=0.601,r=0.475,b=0.773), with ID 5d533467-57cb-45c1-9da9-d12c59d037dc -->

Private capital in the off-grid space is mostly dominated by SHS providers in both rural and urban areas. The Mini-grid sector currently does not have as much private capital investment as most mini-grids are either donor-funded or government-supported. The feasibility studies so far have shown that the development of the mini-grids are less attractive for the private sector in terms of economic and financial returns. Recognising the private sector’s crucial role in mobilising the needed resources to incentivise its participation in the energy sector (both on-grid and off-grid), and unlock additional resources, the government is committed to developing a streamlined review and approval process for developer-led mini-grids and sites selected by mini-grid developers. The government will also fully operationalise the Rural Electrification Act to enter into concessional agreements with mini-grid developers to cushion against losses. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.526,t=0.295,r=0.935,b=0.558), with ID b54cf89a-9655-4c6d-b110-7d61cb2f1758 -->

Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Carbon Financing

The latest national inventory data estimate total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the energy sector contributed to 2.34 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) representing 25% of total emissions. Out of this, fossil fuel use in the transport sector contributed about 1.03 million tCO2e19. In the business-as-usual scenario, Malawi’s GHG emissions are projected to reach 8.18 million tCO2e by 2030. Implementation of various interventions to move towards universal energy access as proposed in this Compact is expected to reduce carbon emissions by 4.09 million tCO2e. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.526,t=0.573,r=0.934,b=0.812), with ID 4e134b22-45ef-4a88-9684-b73396c9f896 -->
